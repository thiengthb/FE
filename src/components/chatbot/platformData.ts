Quitting smoking is a challenging but powerful decision. Our platform is designed to support individuals at all levels of nicotine dependence, whether you want to quit immediately or reduce your cigarette intake gradually. We provide a structured, flexible, and science-backed approach to help you take control of your health. Here's how our app supports you:

1. Quick Start - Smoke-Free Counter
This method is for users who are ready to quit smoking right away, especially those with a low score on the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).

The app automatically counts the number of days you have remained smoke-free.

If you relapse and smoke a cigarette, you can easily reset the counter and start again.

You receive visual progress indicators to help you stay motivated.

This method is ideal for users who want a simple, immediate way to track their progress without engaging in daily input.

2. Daily Tracking - Build Awareness and Habits
This approach is for users with moderate to high nicotine dependence who prefer a gradual reduction strategy. It helps build daily awareness of smoking patterns and forms the foundation of a long-term quitting plan.

You log the number of cigarettes smoked each day.

Special attention is given to cigarettes smoked in the morning and evening, as these times are particularly harmful and habit-forming.

The app tracks your streak of consistent daily reports. If you miss a day, your streak resets.

To accommodate occasional forgetfulness, the app allows you to enter missed data for up to three previous days.

This method supports habit-building and accountability over time.

3. Personalized Reduction Plan - Guided and Adjustable
This feature is designed to support users through a structured reduction plan tailored to their FTND score. It works best when combined with the daily tracking method.

The app generates a suggested quitting plan based on your current FTND score.

You can customize the plan to better fit your lifestyle and pace.

If you try to adjust your plan too aggressively (for example, reducing from a score of 10 to 1 too quickly), the system will alert you to the risks and suggest a more realistic timeline.

This method provides a balance between structure and flexibility, helping users reduce dependence gradually in a safe, supported way.
